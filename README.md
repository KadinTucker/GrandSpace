# Grand Space

A grand(-ish) space strategy game inspired by various space opera/sci-fi games programmed with Python and pygame.

## Running the game

The game is programmed using the pygame library for Python, which is available, e.g. through the `pip` package manager for Python. Check out `pygame.org` for more details.

Python version 3 is best, though I think it should be compatible with Python 2. 

Run the command `python display.py`, and all else being well with your Python/pygame installation, it should work. 

## Why Python

I started this project in December 2023, though I had the idea for it further back. I decided to use Python and pygame after the amateur programmer that is me did not want to wrestle with unfamiliar graphics libraries and deal with programming languages I don't fully understand. Doing it in pygame means I can actually make something resembling progress. 

## The Game

You control a spacefaring empire that has just learned the secrets of interstellar travel. However, you are not the only ones to do so. 

The Galaxy consists of several star systems, each with 1-5 planets. Planets can be colonized and have their minerals harvested and sold to other colonies, allowing for upgrades to your ships, colonies, and more. 

The amount that you can do as a player is limited by how much money you have and how many ships you have. 

More on game mechanics to be described later.
