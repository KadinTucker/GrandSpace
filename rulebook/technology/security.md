# Security

Security is a main-line Empire (Power) [technology](../glossary/technology.md).

Each tier of Security improves defences in [ruled](../glossary/rule.md), causing a star to deal 10 damage per minute per tier to [enemy](../glossary/hostile_action.md) ships.

The damage dealt does not scale with the number of cities, development, or number of colonies in a system.
