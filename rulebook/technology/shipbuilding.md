# Shipbuilding

Shipbuilding is a main-line Warfare (Power) [technology](../glossary/technology.md).

Each tier of Shipbuilding improves ship statistics:
- Speed increased by 150 per tier;
- Maximum health increased by 5 per tier (passive repair rate is also increased to compensate);
- Ship manoeuvre rate increased, meaning ships move to and from planets and stars more quickly. 

Note that ship speed is also increased by the [Spacefaring](spacefaring.md) technology.
