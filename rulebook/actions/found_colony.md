# Found Colony

A ship can found a new colony either in a star system they rule, or in a star system that no player rules. 

Founding a colony costs 2 buildings, and causes a new colony to appear with 1 city. If the colony is founded in a neutral star system, the ship's ruler becomes the star system's ruler.
