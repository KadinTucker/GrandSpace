# Battle

When two ships are in a system together, and one of those ships has the right (see below) to battle another, that ship can carry out the battle action.

While battling, a ship loads its weapons, which takes between 3 and 1 seconds, depending on technology. Once the weapon is loaded, the ship fires, dealing 1 damage to its target.

The ability to target a rival's ship depends on the leverage level from that rival player and the system the ships are in. Your ships have the right to battle rival ships if:
- a rival ship is in one of your own systems and the rival has less than 0 (i.e., negative) leverage over you;
- your ship and a rival ship are in a third-party system (neither owned by you nor the rival player) and the rival has less than -15 leverage over you;
- your ship is in the system of a rival and the rival has less than -30 leverage over you.
