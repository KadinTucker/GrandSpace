# Move

A ship can move in three different ways:
- Across the galaxy;
- Into or out of a star system;
- Between the star and planets of a star system.

Ships move across the galaxy toward a certain destination star system. Ships can also target star systems within their movement range, which is increased with the Spacefaring technology branch. 

The rate at which ships move through the galaxy is improved by the Spacefaring and Shipbuilding technologies. 

Ships that enter or exit a star system take one second to do so.

Ships that move between planets in a star system must first transfer to that system's star, then move to their destination planet from there. Furthermore, exiting the system requires the ship to first exit their planet. Moving within the system one unit takes 0.5 seconds.
