# Siege

Siege refers to a ship attacking an enemy *shield*. 

A ship may only siege in a *system* ruled by a player with at most -50 leverage over the ship's ruler.

While carrying out a siege, a ship cannot perform any other actions, including fighting enemy ships. 

During a siege, a ship attacks the shield with its normal attack rate. Once the shield has taken 15 damage, it becomes conquered. The planet suffers "collateral damage," losing 1 development score (if it has any). 

Once all shields in a system are conquered, the system's colonies change ownership to the conquering player.

A ship may also carry out a siege against an already conquered shield. This is called "looting". After a short amount of time, one of the colony's cities is destroyed and 500 money is earned by the player who looted the city. Having lost a city, the colony therefore loses a shield (one that has already been conquered).
