# Raid

Raiding is the act of stealing either minerals or biomass from a system.

You may only raid the planets of a player with less than -10 leverage over you.

Stealing minerals takes much longer than collecting them, leaving your ships vulnerable to attack in the meantime.

Stealing biomass works exactly as collecting it, but it is considered a raid if you do not have the right to collect biomass there. 

Stealing minerals reduces leverage over the target by 2 per mineral stolen. Stealing biomass reduces leverage over the target by 5.
