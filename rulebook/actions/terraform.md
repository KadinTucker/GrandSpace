# Terraforming

The act of terraforming causes a new lifeform to be placed onto a planet, thereby increasing its habitability.

Terraforming requires a significant investment of money, biomass, and time. 

To terraform, a ship must select one sample from its biomass cargo to be used as a "seed". The new lifeform on the planet will be of the same type as the seed. The player then loses 0-1500 money, depending on the Geoengineering technology level, and 10-60 biomass, depending on the number of lifeforms already present on a planet. The ship then works for 20 seconds, after which time the planet is successfully terraformed.
