# Selling Minerals

A ship can sell minerals at colonies, earning money equal to the price offered for the minerals by the planet.

To sell minerals, the ship must be located at the planet to which they are sold. With the Hypercommerce technology, however, it is sufficient to be within a range of 50 from the colony's star system.

The price offered is by default 50, but is higher if the mineral is of the colour currently demanded by the colony.

The default price is increased to 100 with the Nanomarketing technology

Minerals cannot be sold to planets that do not allow Commercial access.
