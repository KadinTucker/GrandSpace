# Collect Biomass

Collecting biomass refers to collecting samples from the lifeforms on a planet.

To collect the lifeforms from a planet, the planet's lifeforms must not be "exhausted". If the planet's lifeforms are ready to be collected, this is indicated by a filled green bar with a lighter outline around it. 

Collecting biomass takes 12 seconds without technology, and 1 second with the maximum level of the Astrobiology technology. Once biomass is collected, the planet's lifeforms are exhausted, and need 1 minute to regenerate.
