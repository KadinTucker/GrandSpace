# Research

While at a planet ruled by any player, a ship may do research, meaning that they periodically earn money and Neutral science.

A single Research action takes 1 minute, and earns 100 money, 1 Neutral science for the ship's ruler, and 1 Neutral science for the planet's ruler (possibly the same as the ship's ruler). If the planet is ruled by a different player from the ship, then the ship ruler additionally earns 2 leverage over the planet's ruler.

The leverage gained from this action, if any, is boosted by 1 per level of Neuropsychology the player has. 

A player may only perform the research action at a planet where they have Diplomacy access (this always includes their own).
