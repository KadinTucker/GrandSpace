# Schmooze

Schmoozing is an action unlocked and improved by the Neuropsychology technology branch, and increases leverage over the target.

To schmooze, a ship must be at a planet with a colony ruled by the target, and the target must allow Diplomatic access to the player.

Schmoozing boosts leverage at a rate varying from 1 per 6 seconds to 1 per second, depending on the level of Neuropsychology technology unlocked by the ship's owner.
