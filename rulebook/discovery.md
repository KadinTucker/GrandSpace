# Discovery

Discovery refers to exploration of the galaxy, and researching *technology* using *science* points. 

## Artifacts

Exploring the galaxy means looking at star systems previously not looked at. Occasionally, there are artifacts found at 
planets in star systems. 

If a ship enters a planet with an artifact, the ship automatically collects the artifact into its *cargo*. The ship can then, once it 
has reached a friendly colony, sell the artifact.

Selling an artifact grants 500 money and 5 Neutral science points. More on science points below.

Collecting an artifact grants 5 Discovery milestone progress.

## Science

Science points are used to unlock *technologies*, which grant bonuses once unlocked. 

Find a detailed description of each technology *here*. 

There are four kinds of science points:
 - Neutral science points can be used for unlocking any and all technologies
 - Power science points are used for unlocking Imperial and Warfare technologies
 - Prosperity science points are used for unlocking Discovery and Commerce technologies
 - Harmony science points are used for unlocking Ecology and Diplomacy technologies

Neutral science points are more widely applicable than the other types, but harder to earn. Non-neutral science points 
can be traded in for Neutral science points at a rate of 4 : 1.  

Science points can be earned in the following ways:
 - Selling artifacts grants 5 Neutral science points
 - Performing a *research* action with a ship earns 5 Neutral science points per minute
 - Earning a milestone grants 20 science of a type depending on the path:
   - Imperial and Warfare milestones grant Power science
   - Discovery and Commerce milestones grant Prosperity science
   - Ecology and Diplomacy milestones grant Harmony science
 - Participating in *combat* grants Power science:
   - Destroying a rival's ship grants 5 Power science
   - Having a ship destroyed in combat grants 10 Power science
 - Spending 100 money grants 1 Prosperity science
 - *Biomass* can be consumed for 1 Harmony science per 5 value of that biomass

Science points can be freely used to unlock technologies from the technology tree. Technologies have increasing costs: 
the first technology from each branch of the tree costs little science, while technologies further down branches costs 
much more science. For details on the costs of each technology, see *here*.

Researching a technology grants 30 Discovery milestone points.
