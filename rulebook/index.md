# Rulebook

NOTE: at the current state of the game, some of these rules might be out-of-date!

The rulebook to this Grand Space (working title) game is organised much like the rulebook to a complex board game. This 
article contains the introductory information, including the game idea, and a "setup," which, in this case, is a 
description of what you see and will see in the game. Finally, the rulebook ends with a very brief summary of the game's
possible actions, in which links to further articles are included.

## Game Idea

Players compete for success in the galaxy, consisting of several stars scattered across the planet. Players use 
starships (ships for short) to carry out actions and complete milestones. 

## Setup

In the following section, a brief summary of the game's visual components is provided. To find out what each component
is, follow the links to the relevant rulebook entries. Alternatively, read the remainder of the rulebook to gain an 
understanding of the process of the game and how the components fit in.

The initial setup of the game consists of a board filled with stars in different locations. This board is referred to as
the *galaxy*. 

Each star has between 1 and 5 planets orbiting around it. Planets have a color, which determines what kind of *minerals*
can be produced at that planet. 

There are also two other things randomly distributed among planets. *Lifeforms* can be found at planets randomly, and 
are represented by green capital letters. *Artifacts* are also found randomly distributed, and appear as golden rings
around planets. 

Each player gets a *homeworld*. A homeworld consists of a *colony* on a planet. Players will always have their homeworlds
in stars with 5 planets orbiting them. A homeworld starts with seven *cities* and three *development*. The homeworld
also starts with three distinct lifeforms.

At each player's homeworld, that player gets a *ship*. The ship starts with an empty *cargo*.

A ship's cargo consists of all of the items held by that ship, which can include *artifacts*, collected from the galaxy; *minerals*, produced by colonies, which come in 6 different colours; *buildings*, purchased in friendly colonies to carry about colonisation projects; and *biomass*, consisting of samples of *lifeforms* collected from planets.

Each player starts with 1000 money.

## Gameplay

The game's concepts are divided into six *paths*: Discovery, Imperialism, Commerce, Ecology, Diplomacy, and Warfare. 

The paths describe the general gameplay features. The player can expect to experience all six paths during the game, 
though it is possible to play the game without using any of the paths.

### Winning the Game

By engaging with each of the six pathways, a player earns *milestones* from that pathway. Completing milestones earns a 
reward. 

Each pathway has five milestones to achieve. The first player to achieve all five milestones from three different 
pathways wins the game.

The first milestone in a path costs 100 points. The next costs 200, then 300, then 400, then 500. 

To achieve all five milestones, a player needs a total of 1500 milestone points from that path.

### Paths Summary

Discovery: explore the galaxy, collect artifacts, and research new technologies

Imperialism: spread your empire wide across the galaxy, and build and maintain mighty and powerful colonies

Commerce: produce, buy, and sell minerals and generate crazy amounts of money

Ecology: collect samples of lifeforms from across the galaxy and spread them to create habitable worlds

Diplomacy: interact with rivals, earn their trust, and cooperate toward a greater goal

Warfare: raid, fight, and conquer your rivals and prove your worth in great battle

### Possible Actions

There are two kinds of actions that you, the player, can take: those that are player-specific, and those that are done by your ships in-game. Most actions are ship actions.

#### Player Actions

Soft Diplomatic Actions: you can freely send gifts, offer or revoke access, or ask for favours from other players who you have met in-game.

Research Technology: spend science points to unlock a new technology.

#### Ship Actions

##### Basic

Move: the ship moves to the destination star or planet as fast as possible.

##### Discovery

Sell Artifact: if the ship has collected an artifact from a planet, sell that artifact for 500 money and 5 Neutral science.

Research: at a player-ruled planet, earn science points over time for self and planet owner, and leverage, if not ruling the planet

Purchase Science: spend 100 money to earn 1 Prosperty science

##### Imperial

Purchase Building: spend 500 money to add a building to the ship's cargo.

Establish Colony: on a planet without a colony, in a star system not ruled by a rival player, spend 2 buildings to add a colony with one city to the planet.

Build City/Development: spend 2/1 building(s) to increase a colony's cities/development by 1

##### Commercial

Collect Minerals: collect up to all of the available minerals from a friendly colony

Sell Mineral of Colour: sell one unit of a mineral of a particular colour to a colony

##### Ecological

Collect Biomass: spend a significant amount of time collecting one sample of each lifeform from a planet

Terraform: pick one sample of one lifeform and consume biomass, money, and a lot of time to add that lifeform to a planet, increasing its habitability

Lab Research: consume biomass to produce Harmony science equal to 1/5 of its value

##### Diplomatic

Schmooze: earn leverage over a player over time at one of their systems

##### Warfare

Raid Minerals: steal minerals from the planet of an enemy 

Attack: fire a shot at an enemy ship, dealing 1 damage

Besiege: try to conquer a shield of an enemy colony
