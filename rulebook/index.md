# Rulebook

NOTE: at the current state of the game, some of these rules might be out-of-date!

The rulebook to this Grand Space (working title) game is organised much like the rulebook to a complex board game. This 
article contains the introductory information, including the game idea, and a "setup," which, in this case, is a 
description of what you see and will see in the game. Finally, the rulebook ends with a very brief summary of the game's
possible actions, in which links to further articles are included.

## Game Idea

Players compete for success in the galaxy, consisting of several stars scattered across the planet. Players use 
starships (ships for short) to carry out actions and complete milestones. 

## Setup

In the following section, a brief summary of the game's visual components is provided. To find out what each component
is, follow the links to the relevant rulebook entries. Alternatively, read the remainder of the rulebook to gain an 
understanding of the process of the game and how the components fit in.

The initial setup of the game consists of a board filled with stars in different locations. This board is referred to as
the *galaxy*. 

Each star has between 1 and 5 planets orbiting around it. Planets have a color, which determines what kind of *minerals*
can be produced at that planet. 

There are also two other things randomly distributed among planets. *Lifeforms* can be found at planets randomly, and 
are represented by green capital letters. *Artifacts* are also found randomly distributed, and appear as golden rings
around planets. 

Each player gets a *homeworld*. A homeworld consists of a *colony* on a planet. Players will always have their homeworlds
in stars with 5 planets orbiting them. A homeworld starts with seven *cities* and three *development*. The homeworld
also starts with three distinct lifeforms.

At each player's homeworld, that player gets a *ship*. The ship starts with an empty *cargo*.

A ship's cargo consists of all of the items held by that ship, which can include *artifacts*, collected from the galaxy; *minerals*, produced by colonies, which come in 6 different colours; *buildings*, purchased in friendly colonies to carry about colonisation projects; and *biomass*, consisting of samples of *lifeforms* collected from planets.

Each player starts with 1000 money.

## Gameplay

The game's concepts are divided into six *paths*: Discovery, Imperialism, Commerce, Ecology, Diplomacy, and Warfare. 

The paths describe the general gameplay features. The player can expect to experience all six paths during the game, 
though it is possible to play the game without using any of the paths.

### Winning the Game

By engaging with each of the six pathways, a player earns *milestones* from that pathway. Completing milestones earns a 
reward. 

Each pathway has five milestones to achieve. The first player to achieve all five milestones from three different 
pathways wins the game.

The first milestone in a path costs 100 points. The next costs 200, then 300, then 400, then 500. 

To achieve all five milestones, a player needs a total of 1500 milestone points from that path.

### Paths Summary

Discovery: explore the galaxy, collect artifacts, and research new technologies

Imperialism: spread your empire wide across the galaxy, and build and maintain mighty and powerful colonies

Commerce: produce, buy, and sell minerals and generate crazy amounts of money

Ecology: collect samples of lifeforms from across the galaxy and spread them to create habitable worlds

Diplomacy: interact with rivals, earn their trust, and cooperate toward a greater goal

Warfare: raid, fight, and conquer your rivals and prove your worth in great battle

### A Guide to the Game

At the start of the game, you will have only one ship and one colony, and a small sum of money. The money you have available is enough to found one new colony, but you will need more.

Before a proper intergalactic economy can get off the group to fund your spacefaring empire, you will need to fund your expansion by other means. The best way to get this started is by exploring the galaxy and looking for artifacts. Artifacts appear on planets as golden halos around them. Simply direct your ship to one of these planets to collect the artifact.

Artifacts are worth 500 money each, and also grant some science points. 

After collecting a handful of artifacts, you will have explored some surrounding stars. Now you can buy some buildings from your homeworld by clicking on the building icon in your ship's cargo. With these buildings, you can go and colonise a new planet in the galaxy, preferably one with at least one lifeform on it, shown by a green capital letter above the planet and some tree icons on the planet. 

Your new colony won't produce any minerals until you develop it, but it will also have a demand rating. For example, it might be interested in buying minerals produced by your homeworld. If you get so lucky, collect the minerals from your homeworld and sell them to your new colony for some extra funds to get started. 

As you explore you might encounter other spacefaring civilisations. They will have their own colonies to which you can sell your minerals, but they are also competitors for nearby star systems, lifeforms, and artifacts. You can interact with these civilisations, do research with them, and give them gifts of money to show that you are friendly. Your cooperation will facilitate trading and helping each other out in times of need.

With some money collected, you can now start terraforming your worlds. It can also be helpful to research some Ecology technologies to make your terraforming easier. To terraform, start by collecting biomass on planets with lifeforms. Your homeworld has the maximum of three lifeforms, so it is an excellent place to start. Once you have collected enough biomass such that you have a value of 10, you can start to terraform new worlds. This will help your future colonies there, as well as allowing you to harvest biomass from them. 

Having terraformed your worlds, increasing their development is the natural next step. Before long, your mineral production will have increased to impressive levels. If there are people willing to buy your minerals, whether from your own colonies or from those of other players, you will gain immense amounts of wealth that you can use to unlock Prosperity technologies, develop more and new colonies, and more.

But beware: your newfound prosperity may not be all it is cut out to be and may attract the attention of rivals. These rivals might ask for favours from you that they rightfully deserve. Accept them and you agree to share your wealth with them; refuse, and it may end in violence.

If you refuse to give a favour to another player, they will likely gain the right to attack you. They might start by stealing minerals from your bountiful colonies to sell as their own. You can ignore them, but if you choose to fight back, they might be bold enough to fight as well. They may close their markets to you, firing the next shot, and eventually they might come to besiege your massive empire, one colony at a time. You can meet them in battle, but by then it may be too late.

By the time you reach the top of 3 out of 6 milestones, however, you will have won! 

### Possible Actions

There are two kinds of actions that you, the player, can take: those that are player-specific, and those that are done by your ships in-game. Most actions are ship actions.

#### Player Actions

Soft Diplomatic Actions: you can freely send gifts, offer or revoke access, or ask for favours from other players who you have met in-game.

Research Technology: spend science points to unlock a new technology.

#### Ship Actions

##### Basic

Move: the ship moves to the destination star or planet as fast as possible.

##### Discovery

Sell Artifact: if the ship has collected an artifact from a planet, sell that artifact for 500 money and 5 Neutral science.

Research: at a player-ruled planet, earn science points over time for self and planet owner, and leverage, if not ruling the planet

Purchase Science: spend 100 money to earn 1 Prosperty science

##### Imperial

Purchase Building: spend 500 money to add a building to the ship's cargo.

Establish Colony: on a planet without a colony, in a star system not ruled by a rival player, spend 2 buildings to add a colony with one city to the planet.

Build City/Development: spend 2/1 building(s) to increase a colony's cities/development by 1

##### Commercial

Collect Minerals: collect up to all of the available minerals from a friendly colony

Sell Mineral of Colour: sell one unit of a mineral of a particular colour to a colony

##### Ecological

Collect Biomass: spend a significant amount of time collecting one sample of each lifeform from a planet

Terraform: pick one sample of one lifeform and consume biomass, money, and a lot of time to add that lifeform to a planet, increasing its habitability

Lab Research: consume biomass to produce Harmony science equal to 1/5 of its value

##### Diplomatic

Schmooze: earn leverage over a player over time at one of their systems

##### Warfare

Raid Minerals: steal minerals from the planet of an enemy 

Attack: fire a shot at an enemy ship, dealing 1 damage
