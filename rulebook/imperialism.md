# Imperialism

Imperialism involves founding new colonies on planets, and developing existing colonies. 

To build and develop colonies, a ship needs to purchase *buildings* from a friendly colony. Each building costs 500
money, a cost which is reduced through Imperial technologies.

Building a new *colony* on a planet costs 2 buildings. Each new city costs a further 2 buildings, and each development score costs 1 
building. 

A player is said to *rule* a star system if they have at least one colony within that star system (that is, one of the 
planets in that star system). Players cannot place colonies in star systems ruled by other players.

Each planet can have at most one colony. Each colony consists of a number of *cities*, and a *development* score.
 - The number of cities represents the population level of the planet. Each city:
   - increases the maximum number of minerals that can be stored at the colony;
   - increases the defensive strength of the colony;
   - stabilises the colony's *demand* (to be covered in the Commerce section);
   - increases the maximum development score of the colony.
 - The development score represents the industry on the planet. Quite simply, each development score increase the colony's mineral production rate by 1 (per minute).

The maximum number of cities and development score are primarily determined by the planet's *habitability*, to be 
covered in the Ecology section. For now, note the following:
 - Every planet can have at least one city, regardless of habitability
 - Planets without lifeforms cannot have any development

There is one special colony that each player has, which is different from every other colony: their homeworld colony. 

The homeworld colony has a maximum of 7 cities, but only 7 development, compared to other colonies' theoretical 
maximum of 3 cities and 9 development (at maximum habitability). 

Colonising a star system for the first time grants +25 Imperial milestone progress. Founding a colony grants +15 
milestone progress. Building a city, including by founding a colony, grants +10 milestone progress, and improving the 
development score of a colony by 1 grants +5 milestone progress.
