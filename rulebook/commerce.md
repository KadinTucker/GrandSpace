# Commerce

Commerce is also referred to, in short, as "trade". Commerce describes the [mineral](../rulebook/glossary/mineral.md) trade.

[Colonies](../rulebook/glossary/colony.md) with at least one [development](../rulebook/glossary/development.md) score produce minerals. Ships can [collect](../rulebook/actions/collect_minerals.md) these minerals from friendly planets 
and add them to their [cargo](../rulebook/glossary/cargo.md). Ships can then sell the minerals to a colony for money.

## Demand

Minerals come in six colours: red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow. The mineral colours are functionally identical,
except that they are [demanded](../rulebook/glossary/demand.md) by colonies at different times. 

Each colony has a demand, which consists of a colour demanded, and the degree to which the mineral is demanded.

The demand of a colony shows up as an icon with the relevant mineral color and a price for that mineral. A white mineral
icon means that there is no particular mineral demanded.

Minerals can be sold for a base value of 50 [money](../rulebook/glossary/money.md) each. Minerals of the demanded colour sell for between 100 and 500, 
in increments of 50, depending on of the degree of the demand.

A colony's demand changes every 30 seconds, and will either increase, decrease, or reset. An increase in demand means 
the same mineral color is demanded, but the price increases by 50. A decrease in demand is the same, except that the 
price decreases by 50. Lastly, resetting demand means the colony will have no mineral colour demanded, until the demand 
changes again.

In the case that the price would decrease to 50 or increase above 500, the demand is also reset. 

## [Milestones](../rulebook/glossary/milestone.md)

Each mineral sold grants +1 Commerce milestone progress. Each 250 money earned (including by other means than trade, 
but except gifts) grants +1 Commerce milestone progress.
