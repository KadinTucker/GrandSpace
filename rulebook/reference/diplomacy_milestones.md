# Diplomatic Milestones

In addition to earning a small number of milestone points from research missions and schmoozing, there is another way Diplomatic milestones are earned.

Because Diplomatic milestones are more complicated than other paths' milestones, this entry details how these points are calculated.

In short, players who earn more leverage and lose less leverage (not including spending it) will have the highest milestone progress.

The reason diplomatic milestones are so complicated is that a system along the lines of the most leverage earned or cashed-in is easy to exploit, via, for example, two players constantly granting each other gifts.

### The Details

A player's Diplomatic milestone progress is equal to the total of their "leverage advantage" over each other player.

Leverage advantage over another player equals the amount of leverage the former player has earned over the latter, minus the leverage the latter has earned over the former. Leverage lost by ways other than asking for a favour is deducted from the total amount of leverage a player has earned.

For example, if Player A has earned 79 leverage over Player B during a game, asked for 60 leverage worth of favours, and lost 10 leverage from refusing a favour from Player B, then Player A currently has 9 leverage over Player B. If Player B has earned 20 leverage over Player A and asked for 20 leverage worth of favours from Player A, then Player B currently has 0 leverage.

Then, the leverage advantage that Player A has over Player B is 49, which is 79, the total amount earned, minus 10, the total amount lost, minus 20, the amount resulting from the same calculation from Player B's perspective.
