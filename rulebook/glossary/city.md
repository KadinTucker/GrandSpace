# Cities

A city is one of two elements of a [colony](colony.md), the other being [development](development.md). Cities represent population and infrastructure for living in colonies.

Every colony has at least one city. If a colony should cease to have any cities, then the colony will cease to exist.

Cities do the following:
 - Increase the colony's capacity for produced [minerals](mineral.md) by 5
 - Increase the number of [shields](shield.md) a colony has
 - Stabilise the [demand](demand.md) of a colony
 - Increase the maximum [development](development.md) of the colony

The maximum number of cities a colony can have equals the planet's *habitability*. The exception is planets with habitability 0, which can still have 1 city.
