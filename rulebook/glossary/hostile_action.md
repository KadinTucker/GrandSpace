# Hostile Actions

Hostile actions are actions taken with the intention of raiding, harassing, or conquering star systems from other players. 

Hostile actions can only be taken under certain *leverage* conditions. To justify a hostile action against another player, that player must have below a certain threshold of leverage against you. In other words, they need to have done something to offend you or betray your trust before you can take hostile actions.

Hostile actions also cause you to lose leverage over their target. This, in effect, allows the target to respond in kind with their own hostile actions, depending on leverage levels.

Note that one consequence of this is that situations in which a player cannot fight back when attacked are possible. These situations can occur if leverage is extremely unbalanced between players,
or if a player has refused a favour and thereby lost a significant amount of leverage when relations were otherwise positive.

The following is a table describing all hostile actions, and the leverage situation required to take them:

| Action                                       | Opponent Leverage Upper Bound | Leverage Loss                                               | Remarks                                                                                                                             |
