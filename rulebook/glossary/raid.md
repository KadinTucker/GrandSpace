# Raiding

Raiding refers to either stealing *minerals*, or collecting *biomass* from a *planet* where you are not allowed to (see *access*).

Raiding is a *hostile action*, and requires that the target has at most -10 leverage over you.

For each mineral stolen from an opponent, you lose 2 *leverage* over them. For each completed action of collecting biomass from an opponent's planet you lose 5 leverage over them.

Stealing minerals happens at a rate of 1 mineral per 5 seconds, which is significantly slower than collecting minerals at friendly planets. Stealing biomass takes the same amount of time as collecting it legally.
