# Development

Development is a property of *colonies*. Each development increases the colony's rate of mineral production per minute by 1. 

Increasing the development of a colony costs 1 *building* each.

A colony can have a maximum development of the planet's *habitability* times the number of *cities*. 

The following table summarises maximum development by number of cities and habitability:

| Number of Cities | Habitability | Maximum Development |
|------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 1                | 0            | 0                   |
| 1                | 1            | 1                   |
