# Science

Science points are used by a player to unlock *technology*.

Science points come in four types: Neutral, Power, Prosperity, and Harmony.

Neutral science can be used to purchase all technologies, while the other three types can only be used to purchase technologies that they apply to. See the *technology tree* for which technologies can be unlocked with which type of science.

Science can be earned in the following ways:
