# Science

Science points are used by a player to unlock [technology](technology.md).

Science points come in four types: Neutral, Power, Prosperity, and Harmony.

Neutral science can be used to purchase all technologies, while the other three types can only be used to purchase technologies that they apply to. See the [technology tree](../reference/technology_tree.md) for which technologies can be unlocked with which type of science.

Science can be earned in the following ways:

| Source                                                 | Amount          | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
