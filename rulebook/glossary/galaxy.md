# Galaxy

The galaxy is, quite simply, the board filled with [star systems](star_system.md).

Ships can travel through the galaxy by travelling to and from stars in the galaxy. The time is takes to travel between two stars is based on the distance between those stars.

The galaxy is populated with different [artifacts](artifact.md) and unique [lifeforms](lifeform.md), to be collected for various uses.
