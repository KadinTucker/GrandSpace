# Homeworld Colony

The homeworld colony is a special *colony*. Each player starts with exactly one homeworld colony.

The homeworld colony has a different:
- Maximum number of cities, which is 7. More specifically, it is 1 plus 2 per habitability of the planet
- Development per city, which is fixed at 1. 

The in-universe explanation is that the homeworld colony is more supportive of life to your people than any other planet's colony can be. However, in the process to achieve spacefaring status, the homeworld was massively overharvested using unsustainable methods, capping its overall productivity.

In-game, homeworld colonies have relatively strong *mineral* production (if developed), very strong defence, with 7 *shields*, and very stable *demand*.
