# Habitability

Habitability is a property of a *planet* equal to the number of unique *lifeforms* present on that planet, and ranges from 0 to 3.

Habitability can be improved by *terraforming*.

Habitability improves the maximum number of *cities* and the amount of *development* allowed per city in a colony. 
The effect of habitability is summarised in the following table:

| Habitability | Max Number of Cities | Max Development per City | Maximum development with maximal number of cities |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | 1                    | 0                        | 0                                                 |
| 1            | 1                    | 1                        | 1                                                 |
| 2            | 2                    | 2                        | 4                                                 |
| 3            | 3                    | 3                        | 9                                                 |
