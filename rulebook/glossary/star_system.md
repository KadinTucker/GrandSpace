# Star Systems

*Star systems*, or just *stars*, are scattered throughout the *galaxy*, and act as the beacons and anchors of the galaxy.

Every *ship* must either be located at a star or be moving toward a star at any given moment.

Each star system has between 1 and 5 *planets* orbiting around it, and that can be accessed within the star system.

A star system can be *ruled* by a player, if that player has at least one *colony* on planets within the star system. If a star system is ruled by a player, no other player may place colonies there unless they take it over by force.
