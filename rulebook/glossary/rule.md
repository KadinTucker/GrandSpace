# Rule

A player is said to rule a *star system* if they have a *colony* on at least one of that star system's *planets*.

A player may only establish colonies in star systems they rule, or star systems that no player rules.

The player who rules a star system decides what other players may do or not do in that system. This is referred to as *access*. See more in the linked article.

The player who rules a star system may change if all *shields* on colonies are conquered.
