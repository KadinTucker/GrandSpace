# Paths

Paths are the six different gameplay features from which one can earn *milestones*. 

Each path additionally belongs to a "domain", which determines the type of *science* points earned from achieving milestones along the path, and the science points that can be used to unlock *technologies* from that path.

The six paths are: *Discovery*, *Imperialism*, *Commerce*, *Ecology*, *Diplomacy*, and *Warfare*.
