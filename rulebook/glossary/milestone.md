# Milestones

Milestones are achievements that players reach, each following one of the six *paths*. 

A milestone is achieved by gaining "milestone points" toward it. Each path has five milestones to achieve, requiring 100, 300, 600, 1000, and 1500 total milestone points, respectively.

Upon achieving the fifth milestone in three different paths, a player wins the game.
