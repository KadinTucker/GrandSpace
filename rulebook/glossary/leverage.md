# Leverage

Leverage is the cornerstone property of diplomacy. 

Leverage is a property that each player has over each individual other player.

Leverage is asymmetrical, meaning that two players can, and usually will, have different amounts of leverage over each other, 
and it can be positive or negative.

Leverage can be gained in the following ways:

| Action                       | Leverage Gain                                                         | Remarks                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gifts                        | 1 per 50 money                                                        | Gifts cannot be refused.                                                                                                  |
| Granting Access              | Equals the leverage value of the kind of access granted; see *access* | The player to whom access is offered must accept it for leverage to be gained                                             |
| Research at Player's Planet  | 5 per minute                                                          | A player cannot gain leverage over themselves, so this only applies to the research action used at other players' systems |
| Terraforming Player's Planet | 50                                                                    |                                                                                                                           |
| Schmoozing                   | Varies with *technology*.                                             | The action is only unlocked with the "Neuropsychology" technologies.                                                      |

Leverage is used to ask for *favours*. To ask for a favour, the player must have at least as much leverage as the favour's cost. 

Players can refuse favours requested of them. If this happens, the player requesting the favour still spends their leverage, but the player refusing loses twice that amount of leverage.

The following table describes which favours can be requested:

| Favour          | Leverage Cost                                                         | Remarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Granting Access | Equals the leverage value of the kind of access granted; see *access* |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Military Aid    | 25 per minute                                                         | If granted, the player chooses one of their ships to give to the player requesting the favour. The ship then travels to a certain planet and participates solely in *combat* there for the duration. The ship otherwise acts as though it is a ship belonging to the player leasing it. When the duration ends, the ship automatically returns to where it was before being leased. If the ship is destroyed, the player leasing it loses 10 leverage over its owner for failing to protect it, and no Warfare milestones or Power science are granted to its owner or the player leasing it. |

Leverage can also be lost in other ways. Leverage lost in these ways is distinct from leverage spent on favours; the terms "lost" and "spent" are used to make this distinction.

Leverage can be lost in the following ways:


| Action            | Leverage Loss                                                                       | Remarks                                                                                                                                                  |

| Revoking Access   | Equals the leverage value of the kind of access granted; see *access*; see *access* |                                                                                                                                                          |
| Trespassing       | 1 per incident                                                                      | An incident of trespassing is entering a star system, or a planet within a star system, which is ruled by a player that does not grant access to Passage |
| Refusing a Favour | Twice the leverage spent to ask the favour                                          |                                                                                                                                                          |
