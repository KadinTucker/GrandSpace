# Colonies

A colony is a settlement owned by a player on a [planet](planet.md). 

Colonies consist of [cities](city.md) and [development](development.md), which each boost the colony in different ways.

Cities:
 - Increase the colony's capacity for produced [minerals](mineral.md) by 5
 - Increase the number of [shields](shield.md) a colony has
 - Stabilise the [demand](demand.md) of a colony
 - Increase the maximum [development](development.md) of the colony

Development:
- Increases the colony's [mineral](mineral.md) production per minute by 1

The maximum number of cities depends on the [habitability](habitability.md) of the planet, and the maximum development depends on both the habitability and number of cities on the planet. 


| Habitability | Max Number of Cities | Max Development per City | Maximum development with maximal number of cities |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | 1                    | 0                        | 0                                                 |
| 1            | 1                    | 1                        | 1                                                 |
| 2            | 2                    | 2                        | 4                                                 |
| 3            | 3                    | 3                        | 9                                                 |

The exception is the [homeworld colony](homeworld_colony.md), which can have more cities, but less development.

Colonies can be founded on planets within systems that either you [rule](rule.md), or that no player rules. 

Founding, building cities at, and improving the development of colonies requires [buildings](building.md).
 - Founding a new colony costs 2 buildings
 - Building a new city at a colony costs 2 buildings
 - Increasing the development of a colony costs 1 building

Lastly, colonies have a [demand](demand.md) value, which determines the price they will pay for minerals. See more in its dedicated article.

Founding a colony in a new star system grants +25 Imperial [milestone](milestone.md) points. Founding a new colony anywhere grants +15 Imperial milestone points. Building a city grants +10 Imperial milestone points, and increasing development grants +5 Imperial milestone points.
