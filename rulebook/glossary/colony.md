# Colonies

A colony is a settlement owned by a player on a *planet*. 

Colonies consist of *cities* and *development*, which each boost the colony in different ways.

Cities:
 - Increase the colony's capacity for produced *minerals* by 5
 - Increase the number of *shields* a colony has
 - Stabilise the *demand* of a colony
 - Increase the maximum development of the colony

Development:
- Increases the colony's mineral production per minute by 1

The maximum number of cities depends on the *habitability* of the planet, and the maximum development depends on both the habitability and number of cities on the planet. 


| Habitability | Max Number of Cities | Max Development per City | Maximum development with maximal number of cities |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 0            | 1                    | 0                        | 0                                                 |
| 1            | 1                    | 1                        | 1                                                 |
| 2            | 2                    | 2                        | 4                                                 |
| 3            | 3                    | 3                        | 9                                                 |

The exception is the *homeworld colony*, which follows its own rules.

Colonies can be founded on planets within systems that either you *rule*, or that no player rules. 

Founding, building cities at, and improving the development of colonies requires *buildings*.
 - Founding a new colony costs 2 buildings
 - Building a new city at a colony costs 2 buildings
 - Increasing the development of a colony costs 1 building

Lastly, colonies have a *demand* value, which determines the price they will pay for minerals. See more in its dedicated article.

Founding a colony in a new star system grants +25 Imperial *milestone* points. Founding a new colony anywhere grants +15 Imperial milestone points. Building a city grants +10 Imperial milestone points, and increasing development grants +5 Imperial milestone points.
