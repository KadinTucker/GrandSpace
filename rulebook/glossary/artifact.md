# Artifacts

Artifacts are mysterious, valuable objects found scattered across the [galaxy](galaxy.md). Ships that enter planets with artifacts on them automatically pick them up.

Ships can then sell these artifacts at friendly planets to earn 500 [money](money.md) and 2 Neutral [science](science.md). 

A player earns +5 Discovery [milestone](milestone.md) progress for collecting an artifact, and a further +5 for selling it.

### Artifact Spawning

The initial galaxy starts with artifacts in approximately every second star system. However, over time, mysterious 
artifacts become newly unearthed, or possibly replaced.

The more players in a game, the faster artifacts appear. Artifacts appear randomly in star systems, with a higher likelihood to appear in star systems with more planets. 

Artifacts will never appear in colonised star systems.
