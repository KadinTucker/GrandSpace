# Minerals

Minerals are goods produced by [colonies](colony.md) that can be sold for [money](money.md).

Minerals come in six colours: red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, and yellow. The colours are functionally exactly the same, except that colonies [demand](demand.md) at most one colour of a mineral at a time. Colonies produce minerals of their planet's colour. 

The rate of mineral production at a colony per minute is given by the [development](development.md) score of the colony. A colony can store at most 5 minerals per [city](city.md) before it stops producing minerals. Production resumes as soon as these minerals are taken away.

Minerals can be collected by friendly ships, who add them to their *cargo*. Ships can then take them to colonies to sell them. 

The price offered for minerals is based on the demand for the minerals. See more on demand [here](demand.md).

Minerals can also be sold "wholesale", which means other players can purchase them directly from your colonies. The default price is 50 Money, which is the same as the value of selling minerals to a colony, however you get to take that money from the purchasing player. If players constantly purchase your minerals wholesale when you don't want them to, you may want to deny them trade [access](access.md).

Selling minerals, both from a ship and wholesale, grants +1 Commerce [milestone](milestone.md) progress, in addition to milestone progress earned through gaining money.
