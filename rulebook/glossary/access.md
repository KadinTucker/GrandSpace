# Access

Access is a property granted by one player to another player. A player granting access of a certain kind to another player allows the latter player to perform certain actions in their *ruled* systems.

Access can be granted to other players. If they accept it, they are then granted that access, and the player granting the access gains *leverage* over the other, with the amount depending on the kind of access.

Access can be revoked from a player at any time. Doing so reduces leverage by an amount depending on the type of access.

Access can be requested as a *favour*.

The following kinds of access exist:

| Access     | Leverage Value | Description                                                                                                     |

| Diplomatic | 20             | Allows the other player to do *research* and *schmooze* in one's systems                                        |
| Commercial | 15             | Allows the other player to sell minerals in one's systems                                                       |
