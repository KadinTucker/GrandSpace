# Access

Access is a property granted by one player to another player. A player granting access of a certain kind to another player allows the latter player to perform certain actions in their [ruled](rule.md) systems.

Access can be granted to other players. If they accept it, they are then granted that access, and the player granting the access gains [leverage](leverage.md) over the other, with the amount depending on the kind of access.

Access can be revoked from a player at any time. Doing so reduces leverage by an amount depending on the type of access.

Access can be requested as a [favour](favour.md).

The following kinds of access exist:

| Access     | Leverage Value | Description                                                                                                              |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Biological | 25             | Allows the other player to collect [biomass](biomass.md) and [terraform](terraforming.md) in one's systems               |
| Diplomatic | 20             | Allows the other player to do [research](../actions/research.md) and [schmooze](../actions/schmooze.md) in one's systems |
| Commercial | 15             | Allows the other player to [sell minerals](../actions/sell_minerals.md) in one's systems                                 |
| Passage    | 10             | Allows the other player's ships to enter and travel within the system without incurring a leverage penalty of 1          |
