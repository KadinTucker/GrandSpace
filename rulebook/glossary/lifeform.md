# Lifeform

A *lifeform* is an abstract representation of living things, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. Lifeforms are denoted by green, capital letters. 

Each lifeform that is present on a *planet* increases its habitability by 1. No more than one of each type of lifeform can be present on a planet at a time, and no more than 3 lifeforms can be present on a planet simultaneously. 

Samples of lifeforms can be collected as *biomass* by ships from planets on which that lifeform is found. Lifeforms can then be added to planets through *terraforming*.
